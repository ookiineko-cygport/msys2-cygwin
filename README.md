Arch Cygwin
===========

This is an attempt to get a Cygwin cross toolchain on archlinux.

Currently, this repository contains some experimental PKGBUILDs to build a Cygwin cross compiler.

And possibly more packages (or some build tool wrappers) can be added in the future.

## Install

> [!NOTE]
>
> Currently only building on x86_64 archlinux is supported, if you want to build on other architectures,
> which is untested, you can try to follow the [Bootstrapping](#bootstrapping) instructions to build the cross compilers yourself.
>
> Please feel free to open an [Issue](../../issues) if you run into any problem.

All packages are precompiled and available for downloading at [GitHub Releases](../../releases),

to use them, add the following lines to the end of your `/etc/pacman.conf` (note pkgs are currently not signed) and sync the database using `pacman -Syu`:

```text
[arch-cygwin]
SigLevel = Optional
Server = https://github.com/ookiineko/arch-cygwin/releases/download/snapshot
```

Then you should be able to install packages like this: `pacman -S cygwin-gcc cygwin-libiconv cygwin-zlib`

### Building

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Parallel builds might break things sometimes, use a single job to be safe.
>
> You can do this by editing your `/etc/makepkg.conf` and remove `-jXX` from `MAKEFLAGS` (if any).

First, clone this repository using Git and make sure you have installed `base-devel` package group from archlinux repository before proceeding.

And then simply run `makepkg -si` in a subdirectory in order to build and install that package.

#### Bootstrapping

When bootstrapping the cross compilers, build and install the following packages one by one, and in this order:

  * cygwin-binutils
  * cygwin-default-manifest-bin
  * cygwin-w32api-headers
  * cygwin-w32api-runtime-bin
  * cygwin-bin
  * cygwin-gcc
  * cygwin-default-manifest (replaces the `-bin` one)
  * cygwin-w32api-runtime (replaces the `-bin` one)
  * cygwin (replaces the `-bin` one; requires `cocom` to build)
  * cygwin-gcc (rebuild to link against our just-built libraries)

After that other packages can be built and installed normally ;)
